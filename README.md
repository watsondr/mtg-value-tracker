# mtg-value-tracker
MTG deck / list value tracker

MTG Value Tracker is designed as browser redendered software to be run & configured on a server / personal machine. It is fundamentally a crossover of hobby & exploration of python.

The end-goal aim is that one who sets up the software can upload decks via CSV, add cards to collections, see what cards you have and do not have. You can also track the $ change since purchase of any cards, or determine average price for playsets.
